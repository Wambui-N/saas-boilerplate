How to Use the Boilerplate
1. Set up the backend: The boilerplate uses PostgreSQL as the database, and you can easily integrate it with Supabase for data management. You can find the necessary credentials to set up Supabase in your .env.local file.

2. Frontend setup with Next.js: The frontend uses Next.js 14, which provides fast rendering, a rich developer experience, and React hooks out of the box. It's configured with ShadCN for UI components. You can start building your app by editing the pages in src/pages.

3. Payment Integration with Paystack: This boilerplate comes pre-configured with Paystack for payment processing, which works perfectly in regions where Stripe is unavailable. To set up your Paystack integration, you’ll need to add your Paystack public key to your .env.local.

4. Emails with Sendgrid: You can send transactional emails to your users using Sendgrid. Just configure your Sendgrid API key in the environment variables, and you'll be able to send welcome emails, password resets, and more.

5. Analytics: Integrated with Google Analytics, Posthog, and Mixpanel to help you track user activity and gather insights.

6. SEO setup: The project includes built-in SEO configuration for better search engine visibility. The boilerplate automatically configures essential metadata, social media sharing information, and more.

7. Next steps: Customize the UI, add your features, and you’ll have a fully functional SaaS application. You can also extend it with additional features like subscription plans, user roles, etc.
